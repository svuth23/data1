  ## Project 3
  
This project involves in-depth analyzing flight data to derive insights into various aspects such as popular routes, busiest airports, top airlines, and more. The dataset, stored in an SQLite database, contains information about flights, including details like airline names, routes, cities, and flight counts.

This interactive sunburst chart provides a dynamic representation of airline routes, allowing users to visually explore and understand the distribution of total flights across different airlines and their respective routes. 
Hover over different segments of the sunburst to view specific information about airlines and their respective routes.
Zoom in by clicking on a particular segment to focus on a specific airline or route.
Understanding the Chart:
The color intensity represents the total number of flights for each segment.
Use the legend to identify different airlines.
Navigate through the hierarchy by clicking on the chart to explore individual routes within airlines.

This project provides a comprehensive overview of flight data, allowing users to explore and derive insights from various perspectives, supported by interactive visualizations and traditional plots.
